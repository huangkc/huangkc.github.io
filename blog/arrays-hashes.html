    <p>One of the important functions of a program is to store objects. This functionality allows us to, among other things, organize, present, search, and modify these objects. Arrays and hashes are two ways in which a collection of of objects can be held. 
    </p> 
    
    <h4>Arrays</h4>
    <p>Unlike variables, arrays can contain any number of objects of various types, e.g. strings, numbers, other arrays, etc. Basicaly an array is a list whose contents are ordered, or indexed. This way, the program can remember where each item is stored in case we need to access them. A list of names in an array, for example, might look some thing like:</p>

    <p> 
    
    <script src="https://gist.github.com/huangkc/968fc52193f9b393402d.js"></script>
</p
    <p>In this example, "red" occupies the first position, which is idexed at 0, "white" occupies the next position, which is indexed at 1, and "blue" is at postion 2. If a new color is added, it would go to the end of the list at position 3. 

    <p>The list, of course, can contain book/movie/ magazine titles, contact information, personal data, and so on. Since each item is associated with a unique index number, we can add to the list, rearrange the list (sort, alphabetize, etc.), delete items from the list, and modify each item in the list.
    </p>

    <h4>Hashes</h4>

    <p>What if we have a collection of objects to keep track of that do not fit neatly in an ordered list? For example, products and their prices or someone's personal data. Hashes are a useful tool for holding these objects. Hashes are very similar to arrays except the indexes of objects in a hash do not have to be consecutive numbers. Objects in a hash are stored in key/value pairs. For example: </p>
    <p>
      <script src="https://gist.github.com/huangkc/51b20408885c2cc0fcff.js"></script>
              
    </p>

    <p>By associating keys (First Name) with values (John), if I need to access a piece information about John, I can easily find it. Like arrays, hashes also have the ability to add, delete, display, and modify their contents. You can also transform or combine arrays and/or hashes based on your needs. These techniques and the individual attributes of arrays and hashes afford them very powerful data handling capabilities.</p> 

    <p>There is clearly a lot more to arrays and hashes than is presented here. Beyond this introduction, you might explore sorting, searching, filtering, and other techniques for manipulating arrays and hashes. There are also additional techniques for storing collections of objects. Exploring them will provide a more complete picture of the tools available to you.
