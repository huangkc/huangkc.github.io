      INTRODUCTION
Markdown is a text-to-HTML conversion tool for web writers. Markdown allows you to write using an easy-to-read, easy-to-write plain text format, then convert it to structurally valid XHTML (or HTML).

Thus, “Markdown” is two things: (1) a plain text formatting syntax; and (2) a software tool, written in Perl, that converts the plain text formatting to HTML. See the Syntax page for details pertaining to Markdown’s formatting syntax. You can try it out, right now, using the online Dingus.

How was it to wireframe and create an HTML page with a pair? 
We shared our respective designs and discussed the functionalities of each. We also wrote the HTML code for the initial elements of the template. We went over what each code block does and explored possibilities for modification and addition.

Did you find wireframing to be helpful to your development process? 
I found it very helpful in visualizing my design. The process made me think more deeply about what contents I want to have and how to make information flow in a way that is best for the user. Looking over designs that are different from your own can also inspire new ideas for the future even if they do not fit in the current project.

What did you and your pair decide made a good wireframe? 
We decided that a good wireframe would be simple enough to understand and build with our current level of HTML skills but would still have enough sophistication so that future modifications or additions can be implemented without having to redesign the wireframe.

What new semantic elements did you learn about (if any) ? 
I learned about <header>, <nav>, <section>, <article>, <footer>, and <aside> and I implemented most of them in the template.
