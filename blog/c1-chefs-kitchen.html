      Before I came to DBC I wanted to learn to code. I thought DBC was a place to do that but did not have a strong impression of the culture or too many specific expectations of the experience. Based on the video, I think the experience will be more like a practice. One thing I like about the cultural curriculum is that it is largely principle-based. Even though the principles are universal, the way in which they are activated is up to each individual. That means learning takes place long after, and outside of, the experience and that each personâ€™s journey will be unique.

       Engaging this culture means I have to empty the cup so it can be refilled with new knowledge, and so that new insights can arise. It may involve looking inside myself and examining my strengths and weaknesses. It may involve tackling many difficult issues. This is not always easy to do, but this is a safe environment to take risks and experience failure. On the other hand, with the freedom to take the initiative in this pursuit, I look forward to acquiring new skills, gaining confidence, and forging a spirit that will contribute to personal and professional success. I have never been in a learning environment quite like this and I am excited to participate in it.
