  We know that objects are the primary programming constructs in Ruby and that objects have methods. In this post we will distill these concpets further by examining <a href="http://rubylearning.com/satishtalim/writing_our_own_class_in_ruby.html"><strong>classes</strong></a>. In the code "ruby".length, ruby is a string <strong>object</strong> and #length is a method. When we say "ruby" is a string object, we mean that "ruby" is an object (or <strong>instance</strong>) of the string class. Every object in Ruby belongs to a class, and class provides object with methods. The number 1 is an object in the integer class, and mathematical operators such as +, -, /, and * are methods that are applicable to integers.</p>

  <p>
  We can think of classes as a way to organize objects with similar attributes and methods. Once the bleprint is drawn up, we can build as many objects as we want and give different attribute to each object without having to redraw the blueprint every time.

  <p>Lets say we want to  </p>
  <p>

  We know that local variables only live inside methods. Insance variables are create when the class is created and they are visible outside of methods as long as they are within the class. 

  In the string and integers examples, we saw that objects or instances can have their own methods. In those examples, the methods were built-in methods. It is possile to define our own instance methods inside the class.

  use it to teach others when to use instance variables, instance methods, etc. for that object.
