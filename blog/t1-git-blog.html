      This post addresses version control - why we do it and some tools we can use.

      <h4>What Are the Benefits of Version Control.</h4>
      Version control tracks changes you make to your files. Each time a change is made, you have a record of what the change was, why it was made, and when it was made. If it becomes necessary to go back to a previous version for any reason, you would not have to start over. When multiple people are collaborating, version control allows everyone to work on the same files at the same time instead of passing files back and forth.

      <h4>How Does Git Help You Keep Track of Changes.</h4>
      Git is a tool that can be downloaded to your local computer to perform version control management. Git does this by taking snapshots of changes you make. The bundle of changes are then recorded and stored for future reference. With multiple collaborators working on the same files, Git can merge the changes and create a unified version.

      <h4>Why Use GitHub to Store Your Code.</h4>
      GitHub is a repository on the Internet that can store your code. Having your code stored on GitHub means you can access your code at any time as long as you have an Internet connection. Collaboration becomes easier since everyone can work from an identical copy in GitHub. In this way, collaborators can work on the same project at the same time without conflicting with each other.
