What did you learn about CSS padding, borders, and margin by doing this challenge?
I learned to put borders around elements and specify the style and color. I could change the size of the object by maniplating the padding. And I learned to change the position of an element relative to other elements or relative to the edge of the screen by changing the margin.

What did you learn about CSS positioning?
I learned how reative and fixed positions work and how they interact if both of them are on the same page. 

What aspects of your design did you find easiest to implement? What was most difficult?
The easiest aspect to implement was probably setting the dimensions of the elements. The most difficult was to position the elements in the right spot. 

What did you learn about adding and formatting elements with CSS in this challenge?
I learned how to create classes and other selectors and how to add them in CSS. I learned how positioning and formatting properties might interact. Also, many variables could be involved in formatting elements and each one has an effect on the element which can cause the element to behave in strange ways.
